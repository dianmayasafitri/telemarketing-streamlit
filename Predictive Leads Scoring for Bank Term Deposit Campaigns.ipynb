    "# Title: Predictive Leads Scoring for Bank Term Deposit Campaigns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **1. Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The business model for marketing term deposits in Portugal relies heavily on telemarketing as the primary channel to reach potential customers. This activity requires substantial operational resources, including agent time, telecommunication costs, and administrative processes for follow-ups. Campaign success is highly dependent on the ability to understand customer characteristics that are more likely to respond positively to term deposit offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond operational aspects, Portugal’s economic conditions during the 2013–2014 campaign period also influenced customer behavior toward deposit products. According to a Banco de Portugal press release, total non-monetary sector deposits reached €225.6 billion, with more than 70% of public savings held in the form of term deposits or savings accounts. In the post-2008–2010 crisis period, characterized by economic uncertainty, banks relied heavily on deposits as a stable funding source.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, banks conducted intensive telemarketing campaigns, offering products such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Depósito a Prazo 12 Meses – Taxa Bónus Campanha Primavera 2014”,\n",
    "with features including:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\tPromotional interest rate of 3% for the first 12 months (higher than the average deposit rate of 1.3–2%). (https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Portugal/deposit_interest_rate/#:~:text=The%20most%20recent%20value%20is,1%202%203%204%205)\n",
    "*\tMinimum deposit of €5,000, maximum of approximately €60,000 (with special deposit rates for up to 3 years).\n",
    "*\tFully guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund (no risk).\n",
    "*\tNo penalty for early withdrawal.\n",
    "*\tAdditional bonuses for new customers (vouchers, waived administrative fees).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite the attractive product features, conversion rates remained low, and there was a significant imbalance between the number of customers contacted and those who actually opened deposits. Historical data show that telemarketing campaign conversion rates tend to be low: out of more than 40,000 contact attempts, only about 11% of customers ultimately agreed to place a deposit. This indicates inefficiencies in targeting strategies, resulting in many calls that did not generate added value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation highlights weaknesses in targeting strategies, high Cost per Acquisition (CPA), and inefficient data utilization. Given the large data volume and complex relationships among variables (demographics, contact history, macroeconomic conditions, and communication channels), a systematic analytical approach is needed to improve campaign effectiveness and reduce operational waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Impacted Stakeholders :\n",
    "* Marketing Campaign / Telemarketing Division – prepares contact lists and executes campaigns.\n",
    "* Sales Agents – convert leads into deposit openings.\n",
    "* Finance Division / CFO – monitors campaign costs and ROI, including Cost per Acquisition (CPA).\n",
    "\n",
    "# **2. Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Low conversion rates in telemarketing campaigns indicate the need for a deeper understanding of customer behavior patterns and the effectiveness of communication channels. Available data have not been fully utilized to explain which factors influence customers’ decisions to place deposits, nor how interactions among variables contribute to campaign outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-questions to be addressed through data analysis:**\n",
    "1. How do demographic patterns, contact history, and macroeconomic conditions influence customer responses?\n",
    "2. Which age segments show the highest propensity for conversion?\n",
    "3. How effective are communication channels, contact frequency, and call duration in influencing conversion probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced question requiring a machine learning approach:**  \n",
    "4. How can historical data be leveraged to build a predictive model that accurately estimates conversion probability and prioritizes leads?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **3. Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer response patterns based on historical telemarketing campaign data, enabling future marketing strategies to be designed more effectively and efficiently. These analytical insights will serve as the foundation for improving targeting accuracy and reducing unproductive contact activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurable targets:**\n",
    "- Identify key variables that most influence customers’ decisions to open term deposits.\n",
    "- Provide data-driven insights to refine campaign strategies and agent allocation.  \n",
    "- Identify customer segments with higher conversion potential.\n",
    "- Provide a quantitative basis for minimizing unproductive calls.\n",
    "- Produce a predictive model (if required) to estimate customer conversion probability in future campaigns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **4. Analytics Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytical approach begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as the main foundation for addressing problem statement questions related to understanding factors influencing campaign success. EDA is used to identify variable distributions, relationships among features, customer segmentation, and the effectiveness of contact history and communication channels on campaign outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings from EDA then serve as the basis for further analysis, including data preprocessing, handling categorical variables, addressing class imbalance, and creating derived features to enrich analysis quality. These steps prepare the data structure for the predictive modeling stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "When descriptive analysis alone is insufficient for operational lead prioritization, a machine learning approach is employed. Classification models are developed to evaluate conversion probabilities based on historical patterns identified during EDA. This allows organizations to score and prioritize leads more precisely, directing campaigns toward customers with the highest potential to open deposits.\n",

    "2. If the customer refuses or does not open a term deposit after all marketing efforts → the target value is recorded as \"no\".\n",
    "Thus, the variable y represents the final outcome of the telemarketing campaign and serves as the basis for building a classification model to predict customer conversion probability in future campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3. **Dataset Limitations**\n",

    "# **5. Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics assess how well the predictive model distinguishes between customers who are likely to subscribe and those who are not. \n",
    "Performance evaluation relies on the Confusion Matrix, which consists of:  \n",
    "-   True Positive (TP): predicted “yes” and actually “yes”.\n",
    "-   True Negative (TN): predicted “no” and actually “no”.\n",
    "-   False Positive (FP): predicted “yes” but actually “no”.\n",
    "-   False Negative (FN): predicted “no” but actually “yes”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various evaluation metrics are derived from these four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Precision**\n",
    "Formula (plain text):  \n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recall**\n",
    "Formula (plain text):  \n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **F-Score (general formula)**\n",
    "Formula (plain text):  \n",
    "F_beta = (1 + beta^2) * (Precision * Recall) / ((beta^2 * Precision) + Recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) in the Context of Deposit Campaigns**\n",
    "\n",
    "### False Positive (FP)  \n",
    "The model predicts a customer will subscribe, but they are not actually interested.\n",
    "Impact:\n",
    "- Increased operational costs.\n",
    "- Wasted agent time.\n",
    "- Higher Cost per Acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### False Negative (FN)  \n",
    "The model predicts a customer will not subscribe, but they are actually interested.\n",
    "Impact:\n",
    "- Lost deposit revenue.\n",
    "- Lower overall conversion rates.\n",
    "- High-value leads are missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation Priority\n",
    "\n",
    "False Negatives (FN) is prioritized to ensure that no potential customers are missed by the prediction system. A False Negative occurs when the model predicts that a customer will not place funds in a term deposit, when in fact they are interested. This type of error has a direct impact on lost revenue opportunities and lowers the campaign’s conversion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the primary metric we focus on is Recall, which measures the model’s ability to capture all customers who are truly interested. A high Recall indicates that the model successfully minimizes False Negatives, allowing more high-value prospects to be contacted by telemarketing agents. This approach ensures that the campaign runs more effectively, sales opportunities increase, and revenue potential is not wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Primary Metric Selection: Recall**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of term deposit telemarketing campaigns, every False Negative (FN) — a customer who is actually interested in subscribing but is predicted as not interested by the model — results in lost conversion opportunities and potential revenue. False Negatives cause agents to miss high-value customers who should have been contacted, thereby reducing campaign effectiveness. Therefore, as a Data Science team, we prioritize reducing FN as part of our model optimization strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this objective, the primary metric used is Recall, which represents the proportion of truly interested customers that are successfully captured by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula (plain text):\n",
    "Recall = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Recall as the main metric, the model is optimized to minimize the number of False Negatives, ensuring that fewer potential customers are overlooked. This approach ensures that the resulting prospect list is more comprehensive, increases conversion opportunities, and maximizes the overall impact of the telemarketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Age**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average customer age: 40 years\n",
    "* Range: 17 – 98 years\n",
    "* Business insight:\n",
    "The campaign reaches all age groups, including seniors over 90. The bank should tailor its marketing approach and language for younger versus older segments, as they have different product preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Duration (Call Length)**\n",
    "* Median duration: 180 seconds (3 minutes)\n",
    "* Maximum duration: 4,918 seconds (82 minutes)\n",
    "* Business insight: \n",
    "Very long calls usually occur when customers are already interested. However, this variable must not be used for prediction because it reflects the outcome rather than the cause. It indicates that agents are effective once customers are engaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Campaign (Number of Contacts per Customer)**\n",
    "* Average: 2–3 calls\n",
    "* Maximum: 56 calls\n",
    "* Business insight:\n",
    "A maximum of 56 calls indicates potential **over-contacting**, which can damage the customer experience. Contact limits are needed to avoid being perceived as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Pdays (Days Since Last Contact)**\n",
    "* Median & 75th percentile: 999\n",
    "* Business insight:\n",
    "A value of 999 means the customer has never been contacted before.\n",
    "This indicates that most customers are new targets, representing a strong opportunity for first-touch strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Previous (Number of Marketing Contacts Before This Campaign)**\n",
    "* Median: 0\n",
    "* Maximum: 7\n",
    "* Business insight:\n",
    "Almost all customers had never been offered products before.\n",
    "This means the campaign is more suitable for new customer acquisition rather than retention.\n",

    "\n",
    "**6. Economic Variables (emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, euribor3m, nr.employed)**\n",

    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "-   Employment rate ranges from -3.4 to 1.4\n",
    "-   Business insight:\n",
    "Interest in term deposits is strongly influenced by economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "-   When consumer confidence is low (median = -41.8), people tend to seek safer financial products such as deposits.\n",
    "-   Banks can leverage economic trends to predict when campaigns will be most effective.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Key Business Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔  The campaign reaches a very wide age range → marketing messages must be personalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔  Most customers have never been contacted before → strong opportunity for new acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔  Many customers are contacted multiple times → reputation management is needed to avoid spam perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔  Economic conditions strongly influence saving decisions → campaign timing should align with economic trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔  Call duration must not be used for prediction → avoid data leakage."

    "The analysis of call duration distribution shows that most telemarketing interactions are very short, with the highest concentration under 200 seconds. During these brief calls, the majority of customers respond with no subscription, indicating that conversations that are too quick are usually insufficient to drive a purchase decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a different pattern is observed among customers who eventually subscribe to a term deposit. Conversion likelihood increases for calls lasting 150 to 300 seconds, where customers tend to need more time to listen to the product explanation before expressing interest. Although the volume of long calls is relatively small, this medium-duration segment appears to be the optimal window for conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a business perspective, these findings suggest that campaign success depends not only on the number of calls but also on the quality of interaction. Calls that are too short fail to create engagement, while effective call durations—approximately 2 to 5 minutes—are associated with higher conversion opportunities. This insight can guide the design of sales scripts, agent training, and the setting of effectiveness indicators for future calls."

    "1. Decreasing trend in initial contacts (1–4 times)\n",
    "*   Highest conversion rate occurs on the first contact (13%)\n",

    "2. High number of contacts (e.g., >10)\n",

    "*   This indicates that customers with prior interaction history are more likely to place money in a term deposit, possibly because they are familiar with the product or previous offers.\n",

    "2. Customers who have never been contacted (first_contact = 1)\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "* \"duration\" is the length of the telemarketing call (in seconds).\n",
    "* If we include duration in the model, the model would learn from information that is only known after the call is completed, which is unrealistic for making predictions before the call.\n",
    "* This is called data leakage: the model “sees” information that should not be available at prediction time, leading to overly optimistic and invalid results.\n",
    "* Therefore, although duration is analyzed in EDA (e.g., to see if longer calls are usually more successful), this feature is deliberately excluded from model training."

    "After comparing models and tuning with a focus on minimizing False Negative (FN) losses—i.e., potential lost profit—the Random Forest Classifier proved to deliver the best performance in balancing the capture of potential customers and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation results on the Random Forest model using testing data showed:\n",
    "*   Strong Recall: The model achieved a Recall of 84.7%. This is crucial because it indicates the model can capture 84.7% of all customers who are actually interested (True Positives), significantly reducing the risk of losing high-value prospects (FN).\n",
    "*   Performance Balance: Although focused on Recall, the model also maintains competitive Precision, minimizing wasted calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost-Benefit Analysis:\n",
    "*   Model selection and threshold decisions were guided by monetary calculations, where the loss from a single FN far outweighs the operational cost of one False Positive (FP) call. The tuned Random Forest model delivers maximum total net monetary benefit.\n",
    "*   This ensures that every telemarketing effort prioritized by the model is directed to maximize overall net profit, minimize costly FN losses, while still managing FP costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Business Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on modeling results and data insights, management can implement the following three-pillar strategy:\n",
    "* 1. Priority Leads Strategy (Who to Call)\n",
    "Focus should be on customer segments with proven interest. Data shows that customers who have been contacted before (pdays ≠ -1) have exceptionally high conversion rates, reaching 63.8%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive model should prioritize contact lists with a positive interaction history or recent relevant contact history, as these are low-hanging fruit promising the highest return on investment (ROI).\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2. Operational Efficiency Strategy (How to Call)\n",
    "To reduce waste and optimize agent effort, management should enforce strict limits on contact frequency. Conversion rates are highest on the first call and drop sharply after the third call. Therefore, limit telemarketing efforts to 3–4 contacts per customer per campaign period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, agents should be trained to maintain interaction quality within the optimal call duration of 150–300 seconds (2–5 minutes), where conversion opportunities most frequently occur, while prioritizing contact via mobile channels, which have proven more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3. Model Usage Strategy\n",
    "The Random Forest model should be integrated as a daily scoring system to rank the contact list. Telemarketing agents should receive a list sorted by highest predicted conversion probability, as provided by the model, rather than random order or raw demographic criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conclusion:\n",
    "By adopting a model optimized for Net Monetary Benefit, the bank can shift from a volume-driven telemarketing strategy to a value-driven approach, substantially improving agent efficiency and minimizing financial losses from missed high-value prospects (FN)."
